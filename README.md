# Online-Monitoring-of-Performance-Properties-in-STL-with-triggers
This it the repository with the code mentioned in the paper "Online Monitoring of Control System Performance Properties in Signal Temporal Logic with Trigger Conditions" by Elia Ghisellini and Pierre-Loïc GAROCHE.

In this repository, you may find the following:
  1. Lustre code of the Synchronous Observers
  2. MATLAB code and Simulink model of the quadcopter adopted in the linear usecase. It also contains the design specifications of the quadcopter.
  3. C code of the quadcopter model, with synchronous observers, adopted in the linear usecase to generate the results showcased in the paper for the C Framework.
